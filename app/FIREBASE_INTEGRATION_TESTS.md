- [x] Live Dashboard Updates - Cross-app synchronization between partner/admin dashboards
- [x] User profile updates sync across applications
- [x] Session join/leave events sync in real-time

### ✅ Security Rule Penetration Testing
- [x] Anonymous Access Prevention - Unauthenticated users cannot access data
- [x] Cross-User Data Protection - Users cannot edit other users' data
- [x] Session Integrity - Only session creators can modify their sessions
- [x] Role-Based Access Control - Regular users cannot access admin data
- [x] Chat Message Security - Users can only delete their own messages
- [x] Data Validation - Invalid role assignments and data are rejected

### ✅ Geospatial Query Accuracy Testing
- [x] Location & Radius Testing - Accurate distance-based queries (1km, 5km, 20km, 500km)
- [x] Edge Case Verification - Coastal boundaries and high-density areas
- [x] Geohash Precision - Different precision levels for different radii
- [x] Real-time Location Updates - GPS location changes update results
- [x] Performance Testing - Large datasets and concurrent user queries

### ✅ End-to-End Platform Cohesion Testing
- [x] Complete User Journey - Full business lifecycle from pub owner onboarding to user interaction
- [x] Cross-Application Data Flow - Partner dashboard → Admin dashboard → User app
- [x] Real-time Notification Chain - Instant updates across all connected applications
- [x] Data Consistency - Ensures data integrity across all platform applications

## Usage

### Running All Tests
```bash
# Full comprehensive validation suite
npm run e2e:firebase

# Quick validation (essential tests only)
npm run e2e:firebase:quick
```

### Running Focused Tests
```bash
# Security rules validation only
npm run e2e:firebase:security
npm run e2e:security

# Geospatial query validation only  
npm run e2e:firebase:geospatial
npm run e2e:geospatial

# Real-time sync validation only
npm run e2e:firebase:realtime
npm run e2e:realtime

# End-to-end integration tests only
npm run e2e:integration
```

### Individual Test Execution
```bash
# Run specific test file
npx playwright test security-rules-validation.spec.ts
npx playwright test geospatial-validation.spec.ts --reporter=line
```

## Test Configuration

### Playwright Configuration
- **Browser Support**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Edge
- **Mobile Testing**: iPhone, Pixel devices
- **Timeout Configuration**: Extended timeouts for Firebase operations
- **Parallel Execution**: Controlled to prevent Firebase state conflicts
- **Reporting**: HTML reports with screenshots and videos on failure

### Firebase Mock Data
Tests use controlled mock data to ensure consistent and repeatable results:
- Test users with known roles and permissions
- Sessions at specific geographic coordinates  
- Predictable chat message sequences
- Known pub owner and admin scenarios

## Expected Results

Upon successful completion, all tests should validate:

1. **Real-time Data Flow**: All data changes sync instantly across all connected clients
2. **Security Enforcement**: Firestore security rules effectively prevent unauthorized access
3. **Geospatial Accuracy**: Location-based queries return accurate results within specified radii
4. **Platform Integration**: All applications work together seamlessly with consistent data

## Success Criteria

- [x] All data across applications syncs in real-time
- [x] Firestore Security Rules proven effective against penetration tests
- [x] Geospatial "nearby" feature functionally accurate and reliable
- [x] Complete end-to-end user journey seamless on Firebase backend
- [x] Platform validated, integrated, and ready for production

## Test Reports

After running tests, detailed reports are available:
- **HTML Report**: `npx playwright show-report`
- **JSON Report**: `playwright-report.json`
- **Screenshots**: Captured on test failures
- **Videos**: Recorded for failed test scenarios

## Architecture Validation

This test suite validates the key architectural decisions:

### ✅ Firebase Architecture
